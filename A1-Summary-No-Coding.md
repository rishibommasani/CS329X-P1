## Task Summary

Write about the task you picked so your fellow students can understand what NLP task you are working on.

- **NLP Task**: [What's the name of this NLP task? e.g. Sentiment Analysis]
- **Task description**: [e.g., Given a sentence, the model should predict whether the sentence conveys positive / negative sentiment, or whether it is neutral.]
- **Example input/output**:

  ```
  Input: [INPUT EXAMPLE]
  Output: [OUTPUT EXAMPLE]
  ```

## Test Summary:

Write at least 10 tests that you would use to test models in your given task.
