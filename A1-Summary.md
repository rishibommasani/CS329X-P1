## Task Summary

Write about the task you picked so your fellow students can understand what NLP task you are working on.

- **NLP Task**: [What's the name of this NLP task? e.g. Sentiment Analysis]
- **Task description**: [e.g., Given a sentence, the model should predict whether the sentence conveys positive / negative sentiment, or whether it is neutral.]
- **Example input/output**:

  ```
  Input: [INPUT EXAMPLE]
  Output: [OUTPUT EXAMPLE]
  ```

- **Base dataset used in testing**: [dataset name, e.g., IMDB](dataset URL, e.g., https://huggingface.co/datasets/imdb)

## Model summary

- **Model name & url**: [dataset name, e.g., distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english](dataset URL, e.g., https://huggingface.co/distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english)
- **Description**: (A short description as in the [Model Card](https://huggingface.co/distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english), e.g., "DistilBERT-base-uncased fine-tuned on SST-2. This model reaches an accuracy of 91.3 on the dev set")

## Test Summary:

Write the top-3 most useful/interesting tests you wrote in your assignment. All these information should be available in the CheckList `visual_summary_table`.

### Test 1: [Test name]

- **Targeted capability**: [e.g., Negation]
- **Test type**: [e.g., Minimal Funtional Test]
- **Textual description**: [e.g., The model should be able to recognize negation words.]
- **Test cases generated with**: [e.g., templates, perturbation functions, language models, etc.]
- **Test case examples** (each example should have inputs, expected output, actual output):
  - [EXAMPLE 1]
  - [EXAMPLE 2]
  - [EXAMPLE 3]
- **Failure rate**: [Failed number] / [Total number] = [Percent]
- **I find the case interesting because**:
